## REPORTR

Expect this to be completely unstable.

Have you ever needed a way to display your mongodb databases to your boss, or your client, or just pull some stupid reports so you can look cool? Well, I'm trying to achieve that with this module.. Currently, I am going to have this work as an API w/ renderable views for: `CSV`, `PDF`, `HTML w/ Jade` and currently defaults to a restful `JSON` router

### REPORTR SETTINGS
```js
var options = {
  path: "/reports", // expects a string
  type: "json", // will handle `json`, `html`, `pdf`, `csv`
  mongo: {
    ip: "127.0.0.1", // pass a string ip/url
    port: "27017", // pass a string for the port
    database: "test", // pass a string for your database
    user: "user", // pass a string for your database username
    pass: "pass", // pass a string for your database password
    query: "?w=1", // pass a string for your database querystring
    // alternatively you can pass a `uri` string ie:
    uri: "mongodb://user:pass@127.0.0.1:27017/test"
  }
};
```

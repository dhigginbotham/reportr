## REPORTR

Expect this to be completely unstable.

Have you ever needed a way to display your mongodb databases to your boss, or your client, or just pull some stupid reports so you can look cool? Well, I'm trying to achieve that with this module.. Currently, I am going to have this work as an API w/ renderable views for: `CSV`, `PDF`, `HTML w/ Jade` and currently defaults to a restful `JSON` router

### EXAMPLE
```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var server = require('http').createServer(app);

// require our reportr module
var reportr = require('../lib');

// define a port for our application
app.set('port', 1337);
// make options for reportr
app.use(express.methodOverride());
app.use(express.bodyParser());
app.use(express.logger('dev'));
app.use(express.errorHandler());

var reportr_opts = {
  mongo: {
    database: "test"
     // you can pass ip, port, and 
     // database or skip that and pass uri: mongodb... etc
  },
  path: "/"
};

reports = new reportr(reportr_opts);

reports.mount(app);

server.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
  console.log('REPORTR ::.-^-.:: example server starting on %s', app.get('port'));
});
```

### MONGODB SETTINGS
```js
var options = {
  mongo: {
    ip: "127.0.0.1", // pass a string ip/url
    port: "27017", // pass a string for the port
    database: "test", // pass a string for your database
    user: "user", // pass a string for your database username
    pass: "pass", // pass a string for your database password
    query: "?w=1", // pass a string for your database querystring
    // alternatively you can pass a `uri` string ie:
    uri: "mongodb://user:pass@127.0.0.1:27017/test"
  }
};
```

### OPTIONS
Option | Default | Info
--- | --- | ---
**path** | `./reports` | select your route path
**output** | `./output` | folder for csv, pdf file creation outputs
**views** | `./views` | want custom html views? overwrite it with your own.
**engine** | `jade` | don't want to use jade? ok.
**key** | `reportr` | key name for the internal `req` object
**indexes** | `true` | allows access for `system.indexes` to be viewed
**mongo** | `Object` | options to pass to mongodb, creates a new connection stream so it is recommended you use this locally or on a separate instance 
**mongo.ip** | `127.0.0.1` | select the mongodb ip or url
**mongo.port** | `27017` | mongodb port
**mongo.database** | `test` | mongodb database 
**mongo.user** | `null` | username to login with 
**mongo.pass** | `null` | passwork to login with
**mongo.query** | `null` | query, if required you can pass this in
**mongo.uri** | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test` | builds from ip, port, database, user, pass *note, if you just add `uri` it'll use that so you don't have to create all the options

### FORMATS

- `html` - displays html output of db request
- `json` - displays json output of db request
- `pdf` - creates a pdf file of db request
- `csv` - creates a csv file of db request

### QUERY SUPPORT
```md
GET ~/path/:format/:collection
GET ~/path/:format/:collection?key=val
GET ~/path/:format/:collection/count

ALPHA ~/path/:format/:collection/sort?order=+/-key,..
```
